# Quarkus Ledger — Design Document

## Purpose

`quarkus-ledger` is the shared audit/provenance foundation for the Quarkus Native AI
Ecosystem. It was extracted from `quarkus-tarkus-ledger` and generalised so that
Tarkus, Qhorus, and future consumers (CaseHub) each extend it with a domain-specific
JPA subclass rather than duplicating the same patterns.

The extension is intentionally thin: it provides the base entity, hash chain, trust
score algorithm, SPI, and configuration. REST endpoints, MCP tools, and CDI capture
services are deliberately deferred to consumers — each domain knows its own path,
auth model, and event system better than a shared base can.

---

## Ecosystem Context

```
quarkus-ledger        (audit/provenance — this project)
    ↑         ↑         ↑
 tarkus    qhorus    casehub    (each adds its own LedgerEntry subclass)
    ↑         ↑
          claudony
```

**Current consumers:**

| Consumer | Subclass | `subjectId` maps to | Added fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quarkus-tarkus` | `WorkItemLedgerEntry` | WorkItem UUID | `commandType`, `eventType` |
| `quarkus-qhorus` | `AgentMessageLedgerEntry` | Channel UUID | `toolName`, `durationMs`, `tokenCount`, `contextRefs`, `sourceEntity` |

---

## Architecture

### JPA JOINED Inheritance

`LedgerEntry` is abstract with `@Inheritance(strategy = JOINED)`. The base
`ledger_entry` table holds all common audit fields. Each consumer adds a sibling
table joining on `id`.

```
ledger_entry (base — V1000)
  ├── work_item_ledger_entry     ← quarkus-tarkus (V100 in Tarkus)
  └── agent_message_ledger_entry ← quarkus-qhorus (V1003+ in Qhorus)
```

`LedgerAttestation` references `ledger_entry.id` directly — attestations work
for any subclass without any changes. `ActorTrustScore` references `actorId`
from base entries — trust scoring works across all consumers.

### Base Tables (created by this extension)

| Table | Migration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger_entry` | V1000 | Base audit record (discriminator column: `dtype`) |
| `ledger_attestation` | V1000 | Peer verdicts — FK to `ledger_entry.id` |
| `actor_trust_score` | V1001 | Nightly EigenTrust scores per actor |

---

## Supplements

A **supplement** is an optional, lazily-loaded extension to a `LedgerEntry` that carries
a named group of cross-cutting fields. Supplements live in separate joined tables and are
never written unless the consumer explicitly attaches one — consumers that do not use
supplements incur zero schema or runtime cost.

### Why supplements?

`LedgerEntry` is the shared base for every consumer in the ecosystem. Adding optional
fields directly to the base entity creates a wide-table anti-pattern: every consumer
sees fields that are irrelevant to their use case, with no signal about which fields
belong together or when to populate them. Supplements solve this by grouping optional
fields by concern and moving them out of the core entity entirely.

### Built-in supplements

| Supplement | Table | Fields | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ComplianceSupplement` | `ledger_supplement_compliance` | `planRef`, `rationale`, `evidence`, `detail`, `decisionContext`, `algorithmRef`, `confidenceScore`, `contestationUri`, `humanOverrideAvailable` | Recording automated decisions subject to GDPR Art.22 or EU AI Act Art.12 |
| `ProvenanceSupplement` | `ledger_supplement_provenance` | `sourceEntityId`, `sourceEntityType`, `sourceEntitySystem` | Entry is driven by an external workflow system |
| `ObservabilitySupplement` | `ledger_supplement_observability` | `correlationId`, `causedByEntryId` | Linking entries to OTel traces or cross-system causal chains |

### Attaching a supplement

```java
ComplianceSupplement cs = new ComplianceSupplement();
cs.algorithmRef = "risk-model-v3";
cs.confidenceScore = 0.91;
cs.contestationUri = "https://example.com/challenge/" + entry.id;
cs.humanOverrideAvailable = true;
entry.attach(cs); // also refreshes entry.supplementJson
```

### Reading supplement data

**Fast path (single entry, no join):** Read `entry.supplementJson` — a JSON blob
written by `attach()` containing all attached supplements. No additional query.

**Typed access (lazy join):** Use the typed accessors — `entry.compliance()`,
`entry.provenance()`, `entry.observability()`. Triggers a single SELECT on the
supplement table only when accessed.

### Zero-complexity guarantee

If a consumer never calls `attach()`, no supplement table rows are written and the
lazy `supplements` list is never initialised. Consumers already integrated with
`quarkus-ledger` require zero changes.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### `subjectId` — the generic aggregate identifier

Replaces the Tarkus-specific `workItemId`. All queries, sequence numbers, and the
hash chain are scoped per `subjectId`. Consumers set it to their domain aggregate UUID.
The base extension has no opinion on what aggregates are.

### `JpaLedgerEntryRepository` is `@Alternative`

Without this, when a consumer provides its own typed repository (e.g.
`JpaWorkItemLedgerEntryRepository`), CDI sees two beans implementing
`LedgerEntryRepository` and fails at startup. `@Alternative` means the base
implementation yields automatically when a domain-specific one is present.

**Consequence for standalone use:** In a deployment with no domain-specific repo, the
application must explicitly activate `JpaLedgerEntryRepository` via `beans.xml`. No
current consumer has needed this — all provide their own typed repo.

### Flyway version numbering convention

| Range | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| V1000–V1002 | `quarkus-ledger` base | Base schema (reserved — do not use in consumers) |
| V1–V999 | Consumer | Domain tables (orders, cases, channels, etc.) |
| V1003+ | Consumer | Subclass join tables (must run after V1000 — FK constraint) |

This ordering is not optional. The subclass join table has
`FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES ledger_entry (id)`. A subclass migration numbered below
V1000 will fail with `Table "LEDGER_ENTRY" not found` because Flyway merges all
classpath migrations globally and sorts by version number.

### Hash chain canonical form

`subjectId|seqNum|entryType|actorId|actorRole|occurredAt`

`planRef` was removed from the canonical form — it now lives in `ComplianceSupplement`.
Supplement fields are deliberately excluded from the chain: the chain covers the immutable
core audit record; compliance metadata is enrichment, not a tamper-evidence target.

Deliberately excludes subclass-specific fields (`commandType`, `eventType`, `toolName`,
etc.). The chain covers provenance and timing; domain labels do not participate in
tamper detection. This keeps the chain domain-agnostic — the same `LedgerHashChain`
utility works for any subclass.

### `@ConfigRoot` alongside `@ConfigMapping`

`LedgerConfig` carries both annotations. `@ConfigMapping` provides the SmallRye nested
interface API; `@ConfigRoot(phase = ConfigPhase.RUN_TIME)` tells the
`quarkus-extension-processor` to emit the `quarkus.ledger` prefix into the extension
descriptor. Without `@ConfigRoot`, consuming apps see "Unrecognized configuration key"
warnings and cannot override defaults via `application.properties`.

---

## What Is Deliberately Out of Scope

These are excluded by design — consumers implement their own:

| Capability | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| REST endpoints | Each domain has its own path structure, auth model, and response shape |
| MCP tools | Domain-specific; Qhorus adds `list_events`, Tarkus has its own REST surface |
| CDI capture observers | Each consumer wires its own service to its own domain events |
| OTel trace ID auto-wiring | `correlationId` field exists; auto-population from OTel context is a future enhancement, left to consumers for now |
| Event replay / CQRS projections | The ledger is an append-only audit record, not a source of truth for domain state |

---

## Roadmap

### Near-term

Nothing blocking. Extension is feature-complete for current consumers. Wait for
CaseHub integration requirements before adding anything to the base.

### Medium-term

**Quarkiverse submission** — structurally ready (quarkiverse-parent, CI workflows,
full docs, 62 tests across runtime + two examples). Needs a stability decision on the
public API (`LedgerEntry` core fields, `LedgerHashChain` canonical form, supplement API)
before submitting. The supplement architecture stabilises the surface — `attach()`,
`compliance()`, `provenance()`, `observability()` are the public entry points.

**OTel trace ID auto-wiring** — automatically populate `correlationId` from the active
OTel span context. Could be provided as a base helper that capture services call, or
wired directly in the extension using a CDI extension observer.

**Hash chain verification helper** — `LedgerHashChain.verify()` works but consumers
must expose it themselves. A base utility (REST endpoint or service method) that
consumers can opt into would reduce copy-paste.

### Longer-term (depends on CaseHub)

**CaseHub consumer** — CaseHub will likely add a `CaseLedgerEntry` subclass covering
orchestration workflow transitions. Pattern is established; implementation follows
the Tarkus/Qhorus examples.

**`@Alternative` activation documentation** — for standalone deployments that provide
no domain repo, document (or provide) the `beans.xml` activation path.

**Trust score routing signals** — `quarkus.ledger.trust-score.routing-enabled` is wired
in config but not implemented. When enabled it should fire CDI events that routing layers
(e.g. CaseHub task assignment) can observe to prefer high-trust actors.
